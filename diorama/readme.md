> *Miniature faking, also known as diorama effect or diorama illusion, is a process in which a photograph of a life-size location or object is made to look like a photograph of a miniature scale model.* - [Miniature Faking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miniature_faking), Wikipedia

This technique emulates the miniature faking/diorama illusion effect, where a real place is made to look toy-like by clever usage of blurring to simulate the out-of-focus effect caused by shallow [depth of field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth_of_field).

> _Shooting with a shallow depth of field is "having a plane thatâ€™s in focus, and everything else is out of focus._ - [Jeff Carlson, _An introduction to shallow depth of field_](https://www.adobe.com/creativecloud/photography/discover/shallow-depth-of-field.html) - adobe.com
